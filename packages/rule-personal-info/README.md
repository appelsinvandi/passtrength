# Passtrength rule plugin: Personal information

It's quite common for people to include personal information in their passwords.
This can be parts of their name, email, birthday, etc.

This practice however, can be a major compromising factor if this information is available to the attacker.
An example would be a social media site, where the user's email, name and birthday might be publicly available by default.
